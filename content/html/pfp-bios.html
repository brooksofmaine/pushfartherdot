      <p> <strong><span class = "big-letter">A</span>lex Wilder</strong> wrote and recorded his first song in eighth grade. He began collaborating on songs with local musicians, including Clio Berta, and Sean and Jamie Oshima. With the Oshimas, he formed
        the Mostly Brothers Band and began writing and arranging for performing ensembles. As a pianist, he served as a session player for Hannah Batley. </p>

      <p> By his sophomore year at Oberlin, he had decided that music was his calling and persuaded the music faculty to allow to pursue and independent major in theory and popular music. As part of that concentration, he decided to apply his education by
        composing and releasing a popular song by the time he graduated. When he met Will and Nora, he expanded his goal from producing commercial music to collaborating in a band that would compose songs to express the full breadth of people’s experiences.  In February 2016, he traveled to Cuba, where he pioneered documentary songwriting in Spanish. In January 2017, he was awarded a documentary songwriting grant to travel to Barcelona to create Spanish documentary songs.</p>

      <p> In 2015 Alex Wilder and Will Foote invited her to join the Push Farther Project and to provide a cello foundation for the band’s sound. </p>
      <p>Within six months after joining, she also began composing songs from her experience of growing up in a rural American setting and of sailing on the Gulf of Maine. At the University of Oregon, she walks to the music school before sunrise in order
        to fit in practicing cello before class begins. In April 2016, she was awarded first prize for her interpretation of Tchaikovsky&#39;s Rococo variations. In September 2016, she re-located to Barcelona, Spain, where she performs in four ensembles at Conservatori Liceu.

      <p> <strong><span class = "big-letter">W</span>ill Foote</strong> began singing at age eight. He sang from the time he awoke each morning, all during showering, and even while eating breakfast. He took guitar lessons and played and sang, unaware that
        fellow students would sit outside the door and listen to his voice. </p>
      <p>He chose to attend college at St. Lawrence University and was invited to solo in three ensembles. As a sociology major and back-country trail guide, he began reflecting on his experiences and composing songs that expressed emotions in a direct,
        plain-spoken way. In 2014, Alex Wilder heard Will’s voice on a recording and invited him to join him in the Push Farther Project. In December 2015, Will collaborated on a song to document a World War II veteran’s experience as a prisoner in a Japanese
        prison camp.  In April 2016, with fellow songwriter Chloë Isis, he conducted the first-ever live documentary songwriting session on radio. </p>
