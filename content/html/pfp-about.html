      <h5>Beliefs</h5>
      <p> We believe that music can transport people out of normal existence for a minute, show beauty, and bring inspiration. To us, music brings a sense of well-being, optimism, and comfort. We are so appreciative of these experiences, and we want to offer the best that we can make to the world.

      <h5>Mission</h5>
      <p class="text-left">Our mission is to collaborate and create with others and to increase the number of beautiful songs on the planet. Our goal is to craft documentary songs from people's experiences and spoken words.</p>
      <p>We fulfill our mission by presenting live songwriting sessions and concerts. You can learn more about our songwriting method at the Documentary Songwriter site: <a href="http://docsong.org">docsong.org</a>.</p>

      <H5>History</h5>
      <p>The Push Farther Project began as Alex Wilder's project for his degree from Oberlin College. He wanted to apply what he was learning about popular music. He decided to write a song, record a video, and try to earn one million hits on youtube. The finished product is the music video "Push Farther." As soon as we began working together, we knew that we liked playing together far too much to limit our potential to a one-song project. Since then, Push Farther has evolved into a collaborative vocal and instrumental trio, and we are excited to see what will come next.

      <h5>Progress so far</h5>
      <p>
        We have crossed the one year mark as a band. Although we attend colleges in Oregon, Ohio, and upstate New York, we have managed to rehearse and write together through videoconferencing on Google Hangout. We have written 17 songs that document people's experiences and emotions. Over school breaks from school we have created and published an official music video. For our first song, Push Farther, we have earned 2,600 views from videos and live performances.
      </p>
  <!--      <p>
      Although this model of remote rehearsing has worked well so far, we believe that great things will happen when we work together in the same room. We are ridiculously excited about the prospect of devoting an entire summer to our development as a band.

      <h5>What's ahead</h5>
      <p>
        This summer, we want to have the freedom to explore our potential as a band. We will release a live album by September 15th, but that is just our beginning. We will spend the summer writing new documentary songs, rehearsing together (a rare occurrence
        as school normally keeps us thousands of miles apart), and playing concerts in midcoast Maine.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are preparing a kickstarter campaing to raise money for the album project. This campaign will bring us a chance for us to have the time and creative space to compose and record a live album. Without the commitment of school and temporary employment, for the first time we will be able to work together intensely for an extended period of time. Our commitment is that this summer will be just the beginning to creating positive change through music.
      </p>

      <p>
        We know ourselves well enough to recognize that we tend to be intense individuals. We seek to learn how to pace ourselves and work in a sustainable way over the longer term. However, we are all confident that working together in the same room will produce
        awesome results. Thanks for reading about us and for supporting us.</p>
