<strong>Leaving this Place</strong><br>
Words and music by the Push Farther Project<br>
<br>
The guys on the floor became like big and little brothers<br>
Living through the good times and the bad<br>
But time is short for me and my big and little brothers<br>
People on the floor became family<br>
<br>
Here I am leaving this place<br>
I called my home for three years<br>
Although I’ll be back some day<br>
I’ll never leave this old house of ours<br>
<br>
Like 1960s teenagers <br>
In Bye Bye Birdie shirts<br>
We played guitars in Bozzo’s room<br>
Everyone who wandered through could sleep and talk all day<br>
Even when Bozzo was away<br>
<br>
Here I am leaving this place…<br>
<br>
One place I went to by the water<br>
The mountain was right behind the lake<br>
No cars, no sports games, no one around<br>
Little waves crashed against the shore<br>
<br>
Here I am leaving this place...<br>

<strong>Did She Change</strong><br>
Words and music by the Push Farther Project<br>
<br>
I was sitting at a coffee house<br>
Looking out the window<br>
I saw my friend walking by<br>
Blowing me a kiss<br>
<br>
Did she change?<br>
Or did I change?<br>
Or was I wrong all this time?<br>
<br>
For the talking we’ve done before<br>
She was the calm and wise one<br>
She said I was afraid to feel<br>
The size of my emotions<br>
<br>
Did she change…<br>
<br>
When I started spending time with her<br>
I said I’m afraid I’ll fall in love with you<br>
Then she laughed, said it would never work out<br>
And yet this morning she blew a kiss<br>
What’s going on?<br>
<br>
I’m still sitting at a coffee house<br>
Dazed and amazed<br>
I want to call her and ask her out<br>
I bet she’d say<br>
<br>
Did she change?<br>
Or did I change?<br>
Or was I wrong all this time?<br>

<strong>The Beauty In Everyday Things</strong><br>
Words and music by the Push Farther Project<br>
<br>
In a month or two<br>
She’ll be gone<br>
She’ll be flying to Barcelona<br>
I’m losing a life that feels so easy<br>
When she’s near to me<br>
<br>
And I guess I’m scared<br>
That I won’t see<br>
The beauty in everyday things<br>
Cause seeing things through Eliza<br>
Is to see them again<br>
<br>
Like how the rain sounds<br>
Or the view from Beech Hill<br>
She’s got a love of life<br>
That calls to my own<br>
And I don’t want to be with anybody who can’t see<br>
The beauty in everyday things<br>
<br>
I feel her hand<br>
I hear her voice<br>
I don’t know why I think of bells<br>
When she found me, I found beauty<br>
In everyday things<br>

<strong>Little Exchanges</strong><br>
Words and music by the Push Farther Project<br>
<br>
Well I get early in the morning<br>
Before the sunrise<br>
In the hallway there’s the cleaning man<br>
He’s cleaning up<br>
I say good morning and he laughs<br>
He says that not quite right<br>
For you, it’s good morning<br>
For me, goodnight<br>
<br>
Little exchanges<br>
Are all I need<br>
When I’m working hard alone<br>
I could be lonely but for<br>
Little exchanges<br>
Like goodnight<br>
And good morning<br>
<br>
In the winter I tried sleeping in<br>
And came to school a bit later  <br>    
But I missed the quiet mornings<br>
So I got up early again<br>
I saw the cleaning man<br>
The moment I walked in<br>
He said I set my watch to you<br>
Where have you been?<br>
<br>
Little Exchanges….<br>
<br>
He said your shoe’s untied<br>
I said I already knew<br>
I said I’d deal with it later<br>
Like I always do<br>
<br>
Little Exchanges…<br>

<strong>Girl Situation</strong><br>
Words and music by the Push Farther Project<br>
<br>
Life is moving fast<br>
And moving faster<br>
Once those summers<br>
Never seem to end<br>
It seems to move faster<br>
The older you get<br>
And there’s no time for love<br>
<br>
But I’m not giving up<br>
On my girl situation<br>
I’m okay with what I have<br>
Someday it’ll come<br>
But maybe it won’t<br>
I’m not giving up<br>
On my girl situation<br>
<br>
I have a tendency<br>
To work so hard<br>
And push for that something<br>
I want to be<br>
Cause I don’t want to limit<br>
My opportunities<br>
And there’s no time for love<br>
<br>
But I’m not giving up<br>
On my girl situation…<br>

<strong>Nature</strong><br>
Words and music by Peter Di Girolamo, Rohan Edwards, Chloë Isis and the Push Farther Project<br>
<br>
I lived in California for a year<br>
But I hadn’t been up the peaks<br>
It hadn’t rained much at all<br>
I decided I’d take my sleeping bag<br>
And climb one of those mountains<br>
I didn’t take water or food with me<br>
<br>
Nature will treat me as nature does<br>
Nature will treat me as nature does<br>
<br>
The farther up you get and it’s just rocks<br>
But I got right up the peak<br>
Up 10,000 feet<br>
I was looking out into the sky<br>
And I could see one raincloud<br>
It must be half a mile wide<br>
<br>
Nature will treat me as nature does<br>
Nature will treat me as nature does<br>
<br>
It felt like something was crawling in my hair<br>
My hair was standing up<br>
Reaching up for the clouds<br>
I thought I better get out of here<br>
I can’t get struck by lightning<br>
I don’t wanna be a lightning rod<br>
<br>
Nature will treat me as nature does<br>
Nature will treat me as nature does<br>

<strong>Mellow</strong><br>
Words and music by Sarah Bullitt and the Push Farther Project<br>
<br>
I had a black, long haired cat<br>
With enormous soulful eyes<br>
He was my soul friend<br>
I called him Mellow<br>
<br>
He could walk up a wall<br>
And he’d leap up on the trees<br>
He was my soul friend<br>
I called him Mellow<br>
<br>
One weekend I went away<br>
When I came home, he was gone<br>
He was my soul friend<br>
I called him Mellow<br>
<br>
Calling his name through the woods<br>
Through the paths by my house<br>
Sitting under a tree and asking<br>
Wailing, Where is Mellow?<br>
<br>
A month later at dusk<br>
When I looked down to the floor<br>
There was my soul friend<br>
It was Mellow<br>
<br>
He spoke without words<br>
Don’t worry about me<br>
Here was my soul friend<br>
It was Mellow<br>
<br>
Calling his name through the woods<br>
Through the paths by my house<br>
Sitting under a tree and asking<br>
Wailing, Where is Mellow?<br>
<br>
He said, I love you<br>
And then he disappeared<br>
He was my soul friend<br>
I called him Mellow<br>

<strong>Meet Me Halfway</strong><br>
Words and music by the Push Farther Project<br>
<br>
Well, darling you know how much you meet to me<br>
And you know how much I care<br>
I’ll do what it takes to stick with you<br>
Or as much as I can bear<br>
<br>
I’ll communicate, cooperate<br>
But if I’m gonna put the work in<br>
Meet me halfway<br>
<br>
Well, I’ll talk it out from start to finish<br>
Find out what went wrong<br>
I’ll give in, I’ll check in, I’ll let you in<br>
We’ll be back where we belong<br>
<br>
I’ll communicate…<br>
<br>
Some things are beyond my control<br>
Some things just need to be let go<br>
Some things you ask would be harmful to my health<br>
So, babe, you gotta do some understanding for yourself<br>
<br>
Well, I’ll be there when you need comforting<br>
I’ll be there when you’re down<br>
I’ll give you space when you’re suffocating<br>
When you’re lonely I’ll be around<br>
<br>
I’ll communicate….<br>

<strong>Milk Carton</strong><br>
Words and music by the Push Farther Project<br>
<br>
I don’t know if you ever met my uncle<br>
He died nearly four years ago<br>
My mom’s youngest brother, he lived in the woods<br>
In a cabin he built by himself<br>
<br>
He would drink our milk from the carton<br>
And then he would put it back<br>
My mom didn’t like that, she’d get so annoyed<br>
But she still loved to have him there<br>
<br>
Things I hesitate to do<br>
It’s mostly everyday<br>
Like what to wear and what music to listen to<br>
I think of him drinking milk from the carton<br>
And I laugh and say<br>
I don’t care what they thought of him<br>
Or what they think of me<br>
No, I don’t care what they thought of him or me<br>
<br>
He would come to Thanksgiving dinner<br>
And drumsticks he’d eat with his hands<br>
My family wished he’d use a fork and a knife<br>
But they still loved to have him there<br>
<br>
He really liked to play fiddle music<br>
And he also played the blues guitar<br>
He’d write his own songs and play them with me<br>
And he also taught me how to waltz<br>
He taught me how to waltz<br>
<br>
Things I hesitate to do…<br>
<br>
One day we got a call that something happened<br>
He died in the woods by himself<br>
And it was all too soon, so much I could have learned<br>
I wish we’d had more time<br>
I wish we’d had more time<br>
<br>
Things I hesitate to do…<br>
<br>
When I think of him I’m more accepting<br>
Of people who do their own thing<br>
There are people who care and people who don’t<br>
I want to be more like him<br>
I want to be more like me<br>
<br>
Things I hesitate to do…<br>

<strong>That Was the Past</strong><br>
Words and Music by the Push Farther Project<br>
<br>
When we were at York beach<br>
We put our feet in the water<br>
And talked for a half an hour<br>
We got back up and dug a big hole in the sand<br>
The sun was shining<br>
And there were no clouds in the sky<br>
<br>
And then I can’t believe<br>
I heard you say<br>
He still likes you<br>
Don’t you know<br>
That was the past<br>
<br>
You put your face in my shoulder<br>
And cried me a river of tears<br>
You told me he would not leave you<br>
I told you he gave you much more pain than happiness<br>
I reminded you of all the times<br>
You came to me in tears<br>
<br>
And then I can’t believe...<br>
<br>
When we were at the New Year’s party<br>
You stayed by my side the whole night<br>
When 12 o’clock started getting closer<br>
Everyone else had a partner<br>
Everyone else had a partner<br>
You asked me if I could be your New Year’s kiss<br>
And so we kissed<br>
<br>
And then I can’t believe...<br>

<strong>Walk With You</strong><br>
Words and music by the Push Farther Project<br>
 <br>
Started seeing this guy,<br>
This winter maybe last fall.<br>
We were out with friends had too much to drink.<br>
Things progressed rapidly,<br>
But in the morning,<br>
I burst into tears<br>
 <br>
He would ignore me then say,<br>
I make your life better.<br>
He said I want to walk with<br>
You a little longer.<br>
He’d call me crazy then say<br>
I could be better.<br>
He said I want to walk with you.<br>
 <br>
After a month I said,<br>
We should just be friends.<br>
I don’t want to see you romantically.<br>
He said fire’s in my veins. <br>
He turned around and walked away.<br>
 <br>
He would ignore me then say...<br>
 <br>
I found I couldn’t talk.<br>
I had a block in my throat.<br>
I couldn’t say what I wanted to say.<br>
Didn’t want to make decisions<br>
Or be responsible,<br>
I needed to find myself.<br>
I was only a shell.<br>
 <br>
Finally one night<br>
I’d had enough.<br>
I told him I don’t want<br>
To ever see you again.<br>
He started yelling but I stayed strong.<br>
He said forget it and walked away.<br>
 <br>
He would ignore me then say…<br>

<strong>Push Farther</strong><br>
Words and music by the Push Farther Project<br>
 <br>
One night I climbed a silo,<br>
Climbed a silo to sit on top.<br>
Not many people know about it,<br>
150, a pretty steep drop.<br>
Found a picnic table waiting up there.<br>
I saw the stars that night and felt the air.<br>
Push farther, the stars above the silo say,<br>
Push farther, they say.<br>
 <br>
They call it the Grass River,  <br>
One morning I put in.<br>
I canoed through woods and marshes<br>
For hours on end.<br>
An old man at a cabin said, “Come sit.” <br>
So on his narrow dock, I talked to him. <br>
Push farther, the old man and the river say,<br>
Push farther, they say.<br>
 <br>
The Avenue of the Elms,<br>
Long road and shady ground.<br>
At the end there’s a chapel <br>
But the steeple has burned down.<br>
One night I went there, in my bare feet.<br>
I saw the moon where the steeple would be.<br>
Push farther, the fires that burned the steeple say,<br>
Push farther, they say.<br>
 <br>
Additional verses:<br>
 <br>
New York hills and farmland<br>
Remind me of the ocean.<br>
If you go out far enough<br>
Instead of water, grass in motion.<br>
Hard to get to when you don’t own a car.<br>
On a bike it feels like twice as far.<br>
Push farther, the waves of endless farmland say,<br>
Push farther, they say.<br>
 <br>
Seven miles of woods and snow<br>
On cross-country skis,<br>
Hiked an icy hill and saw<br>
A mansion before me.<br>
Two dogs and a carpenter appeared,<br>
Working there for 17 years.<br>
Push farther, the carpenter and the two dogs say,<br>
Push farther, they say.<br>

<strong>Sailing In The Fog</strong><br>
Words and music by the Push Farther Project<br>
 <br>
Hannah – I saw her this summer <br>
For the first time in three years. <br>
At one a.m. in Halifax, when I was on another boat <br>
We talked about sailing Josephine, <br>
When we were only sweet sixteen.<br>
 <br>
How did I do that?<br>
Who in the hell was that person?<br>
Sailing in the fog<br>
I’d be scared to do that now.<br>
 <br>
Hannah and I had left <br>
So sure of our course<br>
To this buoy that we’ve sailed to a thousand times before,<br>
But something went wrong.<br>
All I could see was fog.<br>
How did I do that…<br>
 <br>
We were sending our radio calls to the barges, <br>
Telling everyone that we sailing <br>
With limited engine power, please<br>
Nobody hit us.<br>
 <br>
So we turned around 180 and <br>
Made it back to the breakwater.<br>
We sailed around the harbor to get back our confidence<br>
And then we tried it again.<br>
We found the buoy in the fog.<br>
How did I do that…<br>
 <br>
We were sending our radio calls to the barges...<br>
 <br>
Then the fog bank lifted<br>
As joyous as a sunrise,<br>
And now I get inspiration from the confident sixteen year old<br>
Who managed to pull that off.<br>
I need to be her now.<br>
 <br>
How did I do that?<br>
Who in the hell was that person?<br>
Sailing in the fog,<br>
I need to be her now.<br>

<strong>Either Fall or Winter</strong><br>
Words and music by the Push Farther Project<br>
 <br>
He sits in a field<br>
And thinks about<br>
Where is she now?<br>
He writes a letter, doesn't know what it’s for<br>
It's seven pages long,  <br>
But it haunts him even more.<br>
 <br>
He went to the sea<br>
Some time ago,<br>
Fell in love with her.<br>
He wanted to tell her, but decided to wait.<br>
The summer ended soon,<br>
And by that time he knew it was too late.<br>
 <br>
Now it's either fall or winter,<br>
And he can't make up his mind.<br>
No he doesn't ever call her and he hasn't seen her since,<br>
It's either fall or winter,<br>
And he can't make up his mind.<br>
 <br>
He's wasting his day<br>
At the record store,<br>
And she walks in.<br>
Doesn't even know what she's looking for.<br>
She walks out again,<br>
And the little bell rings above the door.<br>
 <br>
Now it's either fall or winter. . .<br>
 <br>
Oh, where is she now?<br>
 <br>
Well it's either fall or winter,<br>
And he can't make up his mind.<br>
He doesn't ever call her,<br>
And I haven't seen her since.<br>
All those conversations on the beach,<br>
Well it's all my fault you're out of reach,<br>
And all I want is to hold your hand in mine.<br>
 <br>
But I can't, no I can't, leave you,<br>
Cause it's either fall or winter.<br>
Oh, it's either fall or winter.<br>
